iframe is a must, useful for both extension and website owners
therefore there must the injection script layer, containing:

1. iframe
2. avatar
3. danmu
4. image modal
   any more?

how to make dev life easier, ideally, just one repo and I
can run one create react app. This is doable when developing
but difficult when building. Will need to configure webpack manually,
should be possible, do it later
